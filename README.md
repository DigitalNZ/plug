# 🔌 Plug

A Rails engine to turn on/off features (Feature flipper).

### Features

- Supports Rails 3 and above
- MySQL
- Set notices (WIP)

### Prerequisites

- Rails version 3 and above
- MySQL

### Getting Started

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'plug'
```

Execute:

```bash
→ bundle
```

And run the install generator:

```bash
→ rails g plug:install
→ rails g plug:install:migrations
→ rails db:migrate # Newer version of Rails
→ rake db:migrate # Older version of Rails
→ rails s
```

### Usage

Go to `localhost:3000/plug` and start creating features.

Use the provided method to check if the feature is enabled.

```ruby
Plug.enabled?('my-awesome-feature-slug')
```

If you wanted to restrict routes, you can use `Plug::Constraint` class

```ruby
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  resources :blog, constraint: Plug::Constraint.new('my-awesome-feature-slug')
end
```

Notices can be displayed using the `Plug.notice` method.

```erb
<%= Plug.notice('my-awesome-feature-slug') %>
```

If you have custom HTML for notice, you can pass a block.


```erb
<% Plug.notice('my-awesome-feature-slug') do |notice| %>
  <div class="alert">
    <p><%= notice %></p>
  </div>
<% end %>
```

### Running the tests

```bash
→ bundle exec rspec spec
```

### Publishing to `rubygems.org`

Make sure to bump the version. Rubygems don't accept version overrides.

```bash
→ gem build plug.gemspec
→ gem push plug-<version>.gem
```
